    "project_description": "Temet Nosce - Know Thyself - an ancient warrior's theme that resounded throughout my military career and I was reflecting on this and the sum of my experiences in relation to that. This painting is, in many ways, an extension of me.  It relates to my body, in that its size corresponds to my reach, my height, my center of gravity.  I wanted to have my gestural movements captured on the canvas that were tied to my body as I reflected on my experiences. The paintings in this series are abstract and emotionally expressive.  Simply put, the painting succeeds if I or the viewer experience emotional movement from the painting. That transference of energy is healing (and I guess that makes me a sort of healer, a self-healer, or perhaps a shaman). I often paint on a large scale (5' x 7' or larger). This scale matches that of my reach. And the actions captured in the brushstrokes and colors matches the motion of my body as I experience the release of painting.",

    "project_description": "This work explores the transformation of an image through a system of code-based rules and technological processes in a virtual space, with a re-emergence back in to the physical world.  I use my original generative computer code written in Processing (Java) to create the digital images.  From there, I use additional software and a Computer Numeric Control (CNC) router machine to transform the images into wood-cut plates.  These plates are then used on a traditional printing press to create embossings on art paper.  In this way the original spark in my mind filters from through a system of technology to emerge into the physical world.  In this piece, I made every effort to remove myself from any aesthetic intervention in the piece.  From CNC gaffes, splintering of wood, and “perceived ugliness” on my part, I tried to capture every happy accident that occurred in the process of making these pieces.  They were originally going to be ink prints, but my accidental discovery of the embossing effect of the printing press opened an entire new direction of exploration for the series.  The generative software I wrote allows for no human intervention into the aesthetic process.  The algorithm alone determines which shapes go in any given cell of the matrix.  Other pieces in the series (Gatherings, Influenced System) allow varying levels of intervention into the aesthetic decisions. This is a means of exploring human-computer interaction, and the exchange of aesthetic control between the artist and the system they have written. The shapes in this series evoke urban terrain or geography.  These pieces were also featured in the Mercedes-Benz Financial Services Art Show in Fort Worth, Texas, 2017-2018.",

The contest was for the creation of an original illustration to honor the Lakota people as Airbus named the US Army’s newest helicopter after them (in keeping with Army tradition of honoring Native American warriors by naming their helicopters after them - Iroquois, Kiowa, Chinook, Blackhawk, and now Lakota). Because of my early affiliation with the Army, my many years of flying Airbus equipment, my decision to go to art school on my GI Bill, it was a seemed to be a pre-destined culmination of all of my experiences up to that time. And with my newfound honor of winning the contest, I was very humbly afforded a great opportunity - an invitation to the Badlands in South Dakota to the Pine Ridge Reservation to meet the family of Eagle Elk, the Lakota chief whose image I used as inspiration for the piece.\n\nThe image I painted is based on a historical photograph of Eagle Elk from the Library of Congress. Eagle Elk's face becomes one with the mountain and his head-dress becomes one with the clouds. These are both symbolic of strength, a spiritual oneness with nature, and of the eternal spirit of all great and honorable warriors.\n\nA Lakota helicopter skims the treetops in the nap of the earth - another symbol of honorable strength and the ancient warrior spirit in the modern age.",

There is a lot of crossover between painting, drawing, and illustration. And some of the greatest artists did all of those things, with the lines between them often blurred. Often I paint themes with animals or nature when making illustrations. I feel my illustrations are successful when people close to the work are moved by it, no matter the subject.",
