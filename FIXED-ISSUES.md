# Fixed Issues and Improvements

## Build Process Issues Fixed

1. **Error template issue**:

   - Fixed the build-static.js script to use error-modern.ejs instead of error.ejs
   - Updated template loader to handle both legacy and modern template includes
   - Made sure footer-modern.ejs is properly included in error-modern.ejs

2. **Static server improvements**:

   - Fixed path to serve static files from the 'dist' directory
   - Fixed error page path to use the file from 'dist' directory
   - Added better environment detection for .env file loading
   - Added enhanced logging for easier debugging in production

3. **Testing improvements**:
   - Updated build-and-test.sh to automatically test the site
   - Added automated checks for both homepage (200) and error page (404)
   - Improved the build process validation

## Deployment Ready Status

The site is now fully prepared for deployment:

- All static files are correctly generated in the 'dist' directory
- Error pages are working correctly
- The local testing process is robust and automated

## Latest Issues Fixed

1. **JSON Data Visible and Missing Content Issue**:

   - Fixed the EJS syntax error in index-modern.ejs: Changed `<% - JSON.stringify(projects) %>` to `<%- JSON.stringify(projects) %>`
   - Added proper content structure to the modern template including projects grid, single project area, and about artist section
   - Added footer inclusion at the end of the page and fixed script references

2. **Static Server Port Conflicts**:

   - Updated `static-server.js` to handle port conflicts by automatically trying alternative ports
   - Made the build-and-test.sh script more robust by capturing server output and detecting the actual running port
   - Added better error handling for server startup issues
   - Fixed process termination errors by checking if the process exists before killing it

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:

   - Commit these changes to your repository
   - Push to GitHub to trigger the automatic deployment via GitHub Actions

2. **Verify Digital Ocean Deployment**:

   - Once deployed, verify functionality on Digital Ocean App Platform
   - Check that all pages render correctly with proper styling
   - Test error handling in production
   - Verify that all JavaScript interactions work correctly with the new structure

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Consider adding performance monitoring
   - Monitor for any runtime errors after deployment
   - Test the responsive design across different device sizes

## Additional Notes

- The static site generation approach will significantly reduce hosting costs by eliminating the database dependency
- The modern templates provide better aesthetics and improved user experience
- The automated tests will help catch issues before deployment
